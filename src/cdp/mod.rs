//! Minimal CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) Client
//!
//! A hand-crafted CDP implementation with built-in stealth filtering.
//! Only ~20 CDP commands are implemented - just what's needed for browser automation.
//!
//! ## Stealth Features
//!
//! - Blocks detectable commands like `Runtime.enable` (toggle via `Transport::connect_with_options`)
//! - Warns on risky commands like `Emulation.setUserAgentOverride`
//! - Uses a single WebSocket transport over TCP

// Deliberate low-level escape hatch: `Connection`/`Session` (with only their
// generic `send` + accessors public) and `Transport`. The hand-written
// `cdp::types` structs stay crate-private so adding a CDP field is never a
// breaking change.
